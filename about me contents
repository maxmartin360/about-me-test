1.I'm a young professional aspiring to make my own mark on the world through my work as a graphic artist, sports enthusest, and friend. 
2. I think an open mind and a strong set of morals are the most important characteristics one can have. Change is one of the few constants in life, and I welcome it as it brings new oppurtunities that may have been missed otherwise. 
3. I'm from a small cow town located on Maryland's eastern shore. I'm sure some of you may be scratching your head asking "Wut is he talking about, an Eastern Shore?" With a 4:1 chicken-to-human ratio it's not a place I'd recommend investigating. Trust me.. 
I am an avid action sports fan. My parents bought me my first skateboard when I was 13, and now eleven years later I still haven't learned how to put it down. More recently in life I've pursued snowboarding, mountian biking, and road cycling to get my daily adreneline fix, and have no desire to slow down. 
5. My dream job would be to work for any of the action sports companies I've grown up with and support now. Specifically, I'd love to make the designs for skateboards & snowboards, or help design marketing collatteral for a big name cycling company (looking at you Specialized...)
6. Recently, I've fallen back in love with the groovy melodies of the late 70's. If you scroll through the top of my Pandora, you'll find stations dedicated to psychadellic legends like Hendrix or the Doors. I've also a more contemporary taste for electronic music. I love surfing through soundcloud whenever I design to find new music from underground DJ's around the world.
